# Attack-on-MODBUS-communication-to-get-Root-access-of-victim-PC-Provide-possible-solution-with-snort
✓ Using scapy and nmap tools, find out ip/port, ARP SPOOFING &amp; TCP SESSION HIJACKING ✓ Using snort tool provided Intrusion Detection System (IDS). Also, how to bypass this security.


In the report you can find full descreption.


we used 3 types of the attacks to get access of the victim pc in the same network. 
1) ARP spoofing
2) TCP session Hijacking
3) Nmap to get details about network and ip addresses.

1st and 2nd attacks are done using scapy tool. some of the useful commands can be find out from the scapy documentation.

Also tried to secure this communication and checked the details using the snort tool.
